# ChessExercises

This website uses html,css and javascript. For this project I used the following libraries chess.js for [chess](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/blob/master/README.md) rules, [chessboard.js](https://chessboardjs.com/) for the chessboard manipulation and animation and [Chess-Ai](https://github.com/zeyu2001/chess-ai) for the computer to be able to play moves.



Through the website the user can solve checkmate puzzles for checkmate in 1 move or 2 moves. The possible outcomes are playable , checkmate , and draw.
## Features
*  The user can unlock puzzles one _by_ one or solve _any_ puzzle they want by pressing Remove Locks.
*  Each exercise section has 3 example exercise pages.
*  The moves played are being _written_ on board and can be cast back.
*  The moves from solved exercises are saved on local storage.


All pages are in one url and only Fen changes along with
* _title_ , _color_ and _moves_
